## Contributing

The files in the root of the repository are machine-generated. Please do not
edit them directly, only edit the files in the `src` directory.

The `src` directory contains the sty file that does not contain the images and
therefore is reasonably small to edit. Calling `make` in the src directory

1. Generates a pdf with instruction, so it checks that a presentation with this
   style can be complied.

2. Generates the final _sty_ file that contains all images embedded, so the
   template can be distributed as a single file.

## Google Presentation
